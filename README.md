## Development

### Dependencies
All dependencies are installed by default in the
[vm](https://github.com/schramm-famm/vm), but the following links can be used to
install the dependencies on your local machine.

#### Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows for creating dynamic web page
content and is required by Vue.js. Download Node.js from
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### npm
npm is a Node.js package manager. It allows for developers to share and download
Node.js packages. npm is installed with Node.js, so if you have Node.js
installed, then you have npm installed already as well. To check, you can run
`npm -v`, which will tell you what version of npm you have installed.

#### Vue CLI
Vue CLI is the command line interface provided by Vue.js to allow for rapid
Vue.js development. It can be installed by running `npm install -g @vue/cli`.

### Initial Set-Up
When the repository is first cloned, `npm i` should be run to get all of the
repository's development dependencies.
